# My Ubuntu Shell Setup #

## Introduce ##

Since, I hate re-type every command while install a new Ubuntu system from zero.
I tried to write some simple script before, but they are hard to mantain or modify
after system update or something else happended. I want to try another way to 
break such goddamn infinite loop.

## Goal ##

1. Make integrated key-binding while using many programming tools
2. Mainly, key-bindings are vi-like
3. Simple scripts to mantain/modify

## Include ##

tmux
git
bash
(still adding)

## Notice ##

Still on progress, many works needed to do.
